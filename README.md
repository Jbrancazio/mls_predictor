# MLS 2020 Season Predictor

## Abstract

The purpose of this project is to use what I learned in my FIFA World Cup Predictor and try to build an MLS Predictor. I am going to start working with one team in the MLS, LAFC. This will allow me to start gathering the information for this team only and then I can expand from there. I plan on using the OSEMN process to organize my project.

1. Obtain
    - Gather all the game id's for LAFC games
    - Use game id's to gather match data for all games
2. Scrub
    - clean the data for all Games
3. EDA
    - Explore the data to see if I can detect which stats might best predict the outcome of games
4. Model
    - Build a model to predict game outcome
5. Interpret
    - Interpret the results
6. Repeat with all the data from MLS teams
